# Findings

[tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/) is a free open source library that implements sophisticated camera tracking features using advanced image processing techniques as well as computer vision neural networks. May be able to glean glean things from looking at the source code and reverse engineer what we need from there. Ideally we would be able to create our own implementation without using any external dependencies so that it can work on mobile devices.
